# Courses

Welcome to my repository of miscellaneous courses! Here, I document the courses that I have either completed or currently pursuing out of my personal interest and domain. As a lifelong learner, I believe in expanding my knowledge horizons and exploring diverse subjects. Join me on this educational journey as I delve into various fields and acquire new skills.

## Repository Highlights

Here are some of the exciting courses you'll find in this repository:

### Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow by Deeplearning.ai

In this course, I dive into the fascinating world of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using the TensorFlow framework. CNNs are a powerful class of deep learning models widely used in computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.

Throughout the course, I learn the key concepts and techniques related to CNNs, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, activation functions, optimization algorithms, and regularization. I also gain hands-on experience in implementing CNN architectures using TensorFlow, working with real-world image datasets, and fine-tuning pre-trained models.

By completing this course, I equip myself with the skills and knowledge necessary to tackle complex computer vision problems and contribute to the exciting field of artificial intelligence.

### Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow by Deeplearning.ai

This course has allowed me to delve deeper into the world of artificial intelligence by introducing me to Natural Language Processing (NLP) using the TensorFlow framework. NLP is a key component in creating systems that understand, interpret, and generate human language in a valuable way.

During the course, I acquire knowledge about the key concepts and techniques in NLP, including text representation, sequence models, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) units, and the transformer model. I apply this knowledge to implement NLP tasks such as text classification, named entity recognition, machine translation, and question answering, using TensorFlow.

Upon completion of this course, I have gained the competencies to develop sophisticated NLP applications and contribute to advancements in the AI domain.
