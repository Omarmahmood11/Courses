# Courses

Welcome to my repository of miscellaneous courses! Here, I document the courses that I have either completed or currently pursuing out of my personal interest and domain. As a lifelong learner, I believe in expanding my knowledge horizons and exploring diverse subjects. Join me on this educational journey as I delve into various fields and acquire new skills.

## Repository Highlights

Here are some of the exciting courses you'll find in this repository:

### Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow by Deeplearning.ai

In this course, I dive into the fascinating world of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using the TensorFlow framework. CNNs are a powerful class of deep learning models widely used in computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.

Throughout the course, I learn the key concepts and techniques related to CNNs, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, activation functions, optimization algorithms, and regularization. I also gain hands-on experience in implementing CNN architectures using TensorFlow, working with real-world image datasets, and fine-tuning pre-trained models.

By completing this course, I equip myself with the skills and knowledge necessary to tackle complex computer vision problems and contribute to the exciting field of artificial intelligence.
